# Mentoring and Coaching

Hi!

So - you're ready to take the next step in your career? Need help overcoming some obstacles? Want some guidance from someone who's been doing this for a while?

**I can help!**

<hr/>

As a **mentor**, I can work with you to **set goals for your career** and map out a path towards achieving them.

As your **coach**, we can take practical steps towards **sharpening your existing skillset**, and learning new skills.

I can help you build out your professional network, and work with you to overcome any difficulties you're facing.

I'm geniunely driven by helping people. **I get a kick out of seeing other testers succeed.** Let me help you be awesome!

<hr/>

A one hour session is \$NZD60 (employed) or \$NZD30 (unemployed) - but your introductory session is **free**. No obligations or anything.

We can meet in person if you're in Auckland, or over your preferred video chat tool.

Reach out to me at <a href="mailto:james@jpie.nz">james@jpie.nz</a> and let's get started!
