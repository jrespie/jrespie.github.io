### Why JPie coaching?

I've been working in software now for over twenty years, as both a **leader** and an **individual contributor.** 

In my time, I have helped many people take the next step in their careers. That can be through helping get the next role or promotion, navigate difficult working situations, or identifying areas for growth.

If you are in need of a coach or mentor, **[get in touch by email](mailto:james@jpie.nz)**. I'd love to chat.

### Who is coaching suitable for?

I have worked with people in a number of different roles, but my approach has proven most impactful:

<li>With individuals who looking for a new role, and need coaching and advice</li>
<li>With individuals who need mentoring and coaching to overcome particularly challenging working situations</li>
<li>With organisations that don't have dedicated QA management, and need someone to fill the role of giving guidance and support to their QA team</li>
<hr/>

### What happens in a coaching session?

In each session, we will talk about

<li>Your career goals, and what the next steps are to achieving them</li>
<li>Practical steps you can take to sharpen your existing skillset, and learning new skills</li>
<li>Building out your professional network, why it's important and how to progress it</li>
<li>Ongoing challenges in your current role</li>

### What do people have to say about JPie coaching?

_"James coached me during a period at work when I had not long started in the industry, and I was the only QA during a period of transition. He perfectly filled the role of guiding and mentoring me every week. Anything from handling workplace dynamics, addressing general work challenges, or hands on pairing writing tests. It was exactly what I needed."_

> **Ben Ackroyd, Software Developer**

_"The mentorship was truly transformative, with an experienced and empathetic mentor guiding me through each phase of my journey with practical advice and support. James’s encouragement and structured approach helped me overcome fears and achieve my goals with confidence."_

> **Satinder Kaur, QA Engineer**
