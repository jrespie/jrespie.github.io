> What's the difference between mentoring and coaching? 
> 
> *Mentoring* is usually longer term, looks at the big picture, helps you set career goals and a plan to achieve them.
> 
> *Coaching* is usually shorter term, and more specific - like helping you learn a new skill

A one hour session is \$NZD100 (employed) or \$NZD50 (unemployed) - but your introductory session is **free**. No obligations or anything.

~~We can meet in person if you're in the Bay of Plenty, or over your preferred video chat tool.~~

We can't meet in person given the current state of lockdown, so everything will be done by either Hangouts or Zoom!

Reach out to me at <a href="mailto:james@jpie.nz">james@jpie.nz</a> and let's get started!
