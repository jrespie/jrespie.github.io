# Coaching and mentoring

Hi!

If you're interested in receiving some coaching or mentoring, I can help.

I've been testing at various companies around Auckland for the past fifteen years, and have a broad range of experience to draw upon.

I enjoy helping junior and intermediate level testers reach the next level in their careers.

I can help you:
* Set and achieve goals to help further your career in testing
* Get new perspectives on your approach to testing
* Sharpen your existing skillset, and learn new skills

Interested?

A one hour session is **\$50** (employed) or **\$30** (unemployed) - introductory session is free. ($NZD)

We can meet in person if you're in Auckland, or over your preferred video chat tool.

Reach out to me at jamesespie@gmail.com and let's get started!
