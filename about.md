Hi!
I'm James Espie, I'm a software tester, based in Auckland, New Zealand.

I'm also a speaker, coach, mentor, and a bunch of other things. I love testing, and helping others achieve their goals.

This is my website, where you'll find my blog, which is updated whenever I get bursts of inspiration.

Thanks for stopping by!
