#### Monitoring

Today's challenge is:
> What monitoring system is used for your application? Do the alerts it has configured reflect what you test?

Well, the short answer is, we use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for monitoring, and well, we have some pretty good alerting.

But let's talk more about Prometheus.

#### Prometheus

Here's one thing I find challenging: when you join a company and they already have great tooling in place.
It's challenging, because you miss out on a lot of the how and why those tools were implemented in the first place.

So, I thought it might be a good idea to go back to basics, and learn how Prometheus actually works.

I partnered up with my friend Ben to go over the basics of Prometheus - check it out!

#### Thanks and feedback

[Ben's a tweeter](https://twitter.com/BenClapp), so go say hi. Thanks Ben!

Also, I'm still learning how to do 'video' well, so any feedback / suggestions are welcome. Is the ukelele useful or distracting?
