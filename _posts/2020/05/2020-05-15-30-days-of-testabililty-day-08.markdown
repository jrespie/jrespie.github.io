#### A tale of testability

Today's challenge is:
> Share a video about testability with your testing peers at your company

So, I did just that.
The video I shared was [A Tale of Testability](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/a-tale-of-testability), a talk by Rob Meaney from TestBash Belfast 2017.

Click the link to go watch it yourself, I **strongly** recommend it!

#### A tale of a tale of testability

Of course, that doesn't make for a very interesting blog post.

So, I also shared it with one of my former colleagues, **Natalia Matveeva**.

We then got together to share what we *learned* about testability from this talk. 

So, check out my testability chat with Natalia!

I'm grateful to have a testing expert like Natalia as a friend - she gives a great perspective on testability, and testing in general.

Thanks Natalia for joining me, thanks everyone for watching, see you for the next one soon!
