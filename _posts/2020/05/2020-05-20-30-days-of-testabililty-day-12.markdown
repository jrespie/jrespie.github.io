#### Circuit breakers and science experiments

Today's exercise:
> Decomposability is an important part of testability. Complete our circuit breakers testing exercise over on The Club!

The 'circuit breakers' exercise is to take a piece of software, and see how you might use a circuit breaker to it.

I like to think of a circuit breaker in electronics. If there is a fault detected in a circuit (like an overload), interrupt what the circuit is doing.
We can do the same thing in software. Run a function, but if a fault is detected, do something else.

This is really useful for testing - it means you can test something in production, and have a failsafe if it goes awry!

I won't go into too much more detail, I've written [another article on it over on Ministry of Testing](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/testing-in-production-the-mad-science-way).

#### Quiz time!

To do the exercise, I got together with my friend Sonia. We tried to see if we could apply the circuit breaker model to the [Stuff Quiz](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/quizzes).

It's a bit of an over-the-top example, but, it was a fun excuse to do the quiz too :P

Watch us try and do the quiz, and talk about circuit breakers!

#### Thanks

As always, thanks for watching! These posts are getting pretty delayed now, so, thanks for your patience too! We'll make it to day thirty!
