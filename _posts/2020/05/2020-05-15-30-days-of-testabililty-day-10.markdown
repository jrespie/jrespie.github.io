#### Talking about tweets

Today's challenge is:
> Follow and share three people on LinkedIn/Twitter who regularly talk about testability

I caught up with Amrith Shetty to tackle this.
We each picked three tweets or club posts we found interesting, and chat about what we learned.

Take a look / listen!
