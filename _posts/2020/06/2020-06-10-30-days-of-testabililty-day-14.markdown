#### What makes good test data?

Day 14 of the 30 days of Testability challenge:
> Watch the [Testability Ask Me Anything](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/testing-ask-me-anything-testability-ash-winter) on the Dojo. Post any additional questions on The Club.

So, my friend Vincent and I watched it, and then compared notes on our learnings.

#### Testing should be fun
There's a lot of practical stuff that came out of this.
Here's a quick summary of what we learned:
* Testing should be **fun**. If it's becoming a chore, that's a sign there's a testability problem. I consider this a risk too - if it's becoming boring, I find, I start to get sloppy.
* Availability feeds into testability. As a tester, be available to others as much as you can.
* There are other indicators of good or bad testability. Time between deploying and 'starting' testing, time to onboard a new tester, and names of things in your system are all indicators that point to how testable your system is.
