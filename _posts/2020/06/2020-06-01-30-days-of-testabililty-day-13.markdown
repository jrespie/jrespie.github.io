#### What makes good test data?

Day 13 of the 30 days of Testability challenge:
> Find out how test data is populated in your system. How could it be improved? You can watch [Techniques for Generating and Managing Test Data by Omose Ogala](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/techniques-for-generating-and-managing-test-data-omose-ogala) for some ideas to get you started.

I **strongly** recommend watching Omose Ogala's talk on this - it's a great primer on how and why to be mindful of the test data you're using.

But the context I work in doesn't use a lot of test data - at least, not in the traditional sense.

There's some - but I'm working on [Digital Humans](https://digitalhumans.com/), and a lot of the test data comes in the form of conversation, and animation.

#### Digital Humans
So, I figured it would be useful to chat to someone about what makes good test data in this context.

I caught up with our VP of Platform, Tyler Merritt, to talk about what that all means.

#### Learnings
This was a super valuable conversation to me.
Once again, I learned things from talking to someone who is **closer to the customer** than I am. It's becoming a theme.

Specifically, I learned the value of small talk, when it comes to digital humans. A parallel in web development might be microinteractions - little things that make a big difference.

I hope that was interesting for you, I know it was for me. Thanks for watching, and thanks Tyler for taking part!

See y'all for the next one!

#### COVID-19
Oh, and if you want to check out a digital human for yourself, take a look at the [COVID-19 demo](https://covid19.us.digitalhumans.com/) that Tyler mentioned in the vid. Chur!
