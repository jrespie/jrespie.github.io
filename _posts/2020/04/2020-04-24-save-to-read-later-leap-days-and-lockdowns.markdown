Here are a few links from my 'to read' pile that I thought were interesting enough to share. Enjoy!

* February 29 was leap day! [Matt Johnson-Pint](https://codeofmatt.com/) maintains a [list of leap day bugs](https://codeofmatt.com/list-of-2020-leap-day-bugs/). Some of them are interesting, I'm particularly concerned about the kids using [GoHenry](https://gohenry.com) that didn't get their pocket money.

* API contract testing is something that's been coming up in conversation for me recently. [This write up by Kristin Jacknovy](https://thethinkingtester.blogspot.com/2020/03/api-contract-testing-made-easy.html) sums up what it means quite nicely.
<hr/>

* The technical details are beyond me, but apparently, [charging your Macbook Pro with one of the _left_ hand ports uses more CPU than one of the _right_ hand ports](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/363337/how-to-find-cause-of-high-kernel-task-cpu-usage/363933). Aie. (Got the link to this one off [Atila](https://atila.io/), thanks Atila!)
<hr/>

* COVID-19 has meant a lot of people are working from home right now. This of course means a lot of 'tips for working from home' posts. The most useful one to me so far has been [this one from the folk at Postman](https://blog.postman.com/tips-for-working-from-home/).
<hr/>

* It's also meant a lot more people playing games on the internet. To the point where the poor folk at [Catan Universe have had to shut down online play due to the sheer increase in numbers](https://www.catan.com/news/2020-03-31/catan-universe-freematch-temporarily-deactivated).
<hr/>

* Lockdown also brings complications for things like conferences. Ministry of Testing are responding by launching [TestBash Home](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbash-home-2020), a 24 hour test conference from the comfort of your own home. I'll be hosting from **3:30pm NZT**, so join in the fun. I want to see you there, it promises to be amazing. [Register here](https://ti.to/mot/testbash-home-2020), and check out [the full schedule](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/t/testbash-home-2020-schedule-is-live/37046) if you need convincing.
<hr/>

* If you're Auckland based like me, Ministry of Testing Auckland are doing the [30 days of Testability](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/30-days-of-testability) challenge over May & June. I'm hoping to take part, and you should too! The best way to get in on the action is to join the [MoT Auckland Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/wetestauckland/shared_invite/enQtNDY3OTQyMTg0MTgyLTAwMDk1NGMyOTc0ZDkwZTUxMTFiMzRiNjE2Mjc2MTI3ZWU0ZmY2MzJlNGJkMGQzY2MwZDY2OTMzMTI3ZjNlNTY).
<hr/>

* Finally, as I was writing this, my friend Bond informed me that [Valve have had a source code leak](https://threatpost.com/valve-confirms-csgo-team-fortress-2-source-code-leak/155092/). Reading about it makes me want to play TF2 now, if I'm honest.

Thanks for reading! It's a long weekend here in NZ, so I'll be relaxing (at home, obviously) - hope you are too!
