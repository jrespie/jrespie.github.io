#### The Team Guide to Testability

Today's challenge:
> What book did you choose on Day 3 and what did you learn from it?

If you remember way back on [Day 3](/2020/05/06/30-days-of-testability-day-03.html), my friend Oliver and I committed to reading the [Team Guide to Testability](https://leanpub.com/softwaretestability) by Rob Meaney and Ash Winter.

We did! Here's what we thought of it.

#### Practical exercises

I think the most valuable thing we took from this book was that there are *practical* things you can do to encourage testability in your team.
The book gives several exercises to try, including the [Team Testability Test](https://github.com/ConfluxDigital/testability-questions/blob/master/testability-questions.md) and the [Ten Ps of Testability](https://www.slideshare.net/AshWinter/10-ps-of-testability).

I am looking forward to trying one of these with my teams, and I'll report back when done!

#### Review
Firstly, it was great to have Oliver join me for this - thanks Oliver!
In other news, life has gotten busy since starting this exercise. It's a thirty day challenge, and it's taken me almost six months to do just over half of them.

I've felt like I can't blog anything else until I finish this, but I don't think that's the right approach. Because there are other things I want to post!
So, I'm going to put the 30 day challenge on hiatus. I still intend on backfilling the remaining items, but I'm just going to do the exercises as and when I feel like it.

Stay tuned for some (hopefully) engaging and exciting posts soon.
As always, thanks for reading, it's a pleasure to have you along for the ride!
