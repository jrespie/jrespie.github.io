# "Save to read later"
## Neat things from around the internet. Featuring Tesla, Thanos and a tremendous lawsuit.

Here are some interesting things from the last few weeks

* [Hackers steered a Tesla into oncoming traffic by placing 3 small stickers on the road.](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/tesla-hackers-steer-into-oncoming-traffic-with-stickers-on-the-road-2019-4) The headline says it all - I'd love to be able to test things like this some day. I mean, I guess there's nothing stopping me now, except I don't own a Tesla...
* I'll pretty much love anything that combines art and testing - such as [Learning testing is like learning to paint](https://trishkhoo.com/2019/04/learning-testing-is-like-learning-to-paint/) by Trish Khoo
* I also love anything that combines comic book characters and testing. Jeff Nyman asks ["What would happen if Thanos made half your tests disappear"](http://testerstories.com/2019/04/the-test-snap/)?
* On a similar thread, [this post from Stu Johnson](https://wildtests.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/kill-your-darlings-why-deleting-tests-raises-software-quality/) is a great discussion on deleting tests with enthusiasm.
* The story of [Hertz suing Accenture](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/04/23/hertz_accenture_lawsuit/) for a failed online rebuild is fascinating. It also seems all too familiar in some places. Dave Guarino also has a good writeup in [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/allafarce/status/1121174850226147328).
* Finally, here's [Flukeout](https://flukeout.github.io/), a fun little game for learning CSS selectors. (I saw [Richard Bradshaw](https://thefriendlytester.co.uk/) post this on LinkedIn)
