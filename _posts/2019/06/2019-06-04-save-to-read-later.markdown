It's been a while! I have a folder full of drafts, but haven't had much time to publish anything.
Here's a little something, meatier posts are incoming.

* This is probably a bit old now, but a canary release of [Microsoft Edge is available for MacOS](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download?platform=macos). Seeing the Edge logo in my MacOS toolbar is a little trippy, and will be even trippier when it's blue.
* [Postman also has a new canary release out](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/canary), this one featuring support for *GraphQL*. This is a feature I've been awaiting for a long time, and I'm really enjoying playing with it so far!
* [Katrina Clokie](https://twitter.com/katrinaclokie) is one of my favourite presenters-slash-writers on testing and software engineering. Her keynote from STAREAST on [Test Automation as Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=430&v=FlIgoBPqjOo) is totally worth a watch. I'm especially inspired by the second section around declaring a vision for test automation. I don't think I've ever worked in a team that has done this explicitly (but I'd like to).
* While we're talking art, my buddy [Dan](https://twitter.com/daniel_gasson) has been playing around with CSS art. Check out this old timey camera he's drawn _just_ using CSS and HTML. I love this stuff.
*  The NZ Government's budget [was leaked early thanks to a security flaw](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/390846/budget-breach-didn-t-break-the-law-treasury). It raises some interesting questions as to the morality and legality of this behaviour, as breach came from people within government. Stuff.co.nz has a [video demonstration](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/113112357/nationals-simon-bridges-calls-on-grant-robertson-and-treasury-secretary-to-resign-following-website-bungle) of how it was done. (Thanks [Vincent](https://twitter.com/vincentdirks) for the article!)
* This blog post from portswigger about [finding security flaws in Firefox](https://portswigger.net/blog/provoking-browser-quirks-with-behavioural-fuzzing) is great. Well worth taking the time to read and understand, and practicing the examples.


Cheers!
