# "Save to read later"
## Neat or interesting or useful things from around the internet

I really like those blogs that regularly post cool / interesting collections of links.

So, ~~I'm stealing the idea~~ using that as inspiration to do it myself. I doubt I'll do it regularly though, just as and when I've got a backlog of bookmarks I think are neat.

So here goes!

* [The **A/B Testing Podcast** has just hit it's 100th episode](https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/). It's one of my favourite podcasts, and definitely worth a listen.
* **[Illustrated.dev](https://illustrated.dev/)** is a collection of hand drawn illustrations of development concepts. It's informative and beautiful, and one of the coolest things I've seen for a while. (I got this off [Atila](https://atila.fassina.eu/), thanks Atila!).
* FrontEnd Masters have published the [2019 update of their **Front End Developers Handbook**](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/). It's not the sort of thing you'd just read in one hit, but there's some neato information and references there.
* The trailer was released for the new Star Wars game, **[Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/videos/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-official-story-reveal-/2300-6449141/)**. That's cool and all, but what stood out to me is the news that it's purely a single player game. [No multiplayer, no microtransactions](https://www.gamerevolution.com/news/524577-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-single-player-no-microtransactions), and [no DLC](https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/526043-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-dlc-roadmap). Which appeals to me greatly. ([Nigel](https://compiledexperience.com/) told me about this one, thanks
* Ever wanted to know how to do a good code review? [John Barton](https://johnbarton.co/) has a [GitHub repo with a boatload of resources for doing ~~good~~ **awesome** code reviews](https://github.com/joho/awesome-code-review). ([Alix](https://twitter.com/evolutionises) posted this in one of the slack teams I'm in. Thanks Alix!)
* Finally, the lineup for **[TestBash Australia](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbash-australia-2019)** has been announced and it looks *dope*. [Dan Billing](https://thetestdoctor.co.uk/), [Mike Talks](https://twitter.com/TestSheepNZ), [Trish Khoo](https://trishkhoo.com/), [Angie Jones](http://angiejones.tech/), [Nick Pass](https://twitter.com/SlatS), and many more awesome speakers and teachers.
Note that it's only a few days before [TestBash New Zealand](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbash-new-zealand-2019) (lineup TBA), so this is a good chance to take a week off and do a testing tour down under!

That's all for now, I'm off to the beach for the next nine days. If you're taking an Easter break, have a good one! If you're working through... don't work too hard!
